    <h1>Div Element In HTML</h1>
    <p>Div stands for "Content Division Element". It is primarily used to group various tags together into a block element, and to seperate various sections of content in the page.</p>
    <p>Div is a block-level element.</p>

    <div>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
    </div>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>

    <p>Here, you can see that Google And Facebook are inline, but Youtube is block.</p>
    <p>Actually, Google And Facebook are placed in a div. Essentially, a div is like creating a webpage within a webpage. So Google And Facebook are given their own width.</p>
    <p>Factually, all anchor tags are inline.</p>
