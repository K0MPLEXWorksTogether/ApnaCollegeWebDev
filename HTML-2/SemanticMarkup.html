    <h1>Semantic Markup In HTML</h1>
    Semantic literally means "Meaning". There are two types of tags in HTML:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Semantic Tags</b>: These are the tags
            that provide formatting such that just
            by looking at the tag, we can guess
            the semantic meaning of the content inside 
            it. For example, consider the heading tags.
            Just by looking at them, we can easily
            figure out the contextual meaning of the 
            content inside it.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Non-Semantic Tags</b>: These are the
            tags whose formatting is not that clear
            with respect to the contextual meaning.
            These tags are rather used for the grouping
            and targetting of style for the content
            of the webpage. Consider the div tag. By
            looking at the tag you cannot say what
            it is doing.
        </li>
    </ol>
