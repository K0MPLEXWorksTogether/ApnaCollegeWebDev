    <h1>Extra Tags In HTML</h1>

    <h2>Line Break</h2>
    <p>It is typically used to create line spaces (breaks) between paragraphs.</p>

    <p><i>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    </i></p>

    <p>The poem displayed above has been embedded into only one paragraph tag.</p>

    <h2>Bold, Italic And Underline</h2>
    <p>As the name suggests, these tags are used for representing text in bold, italic and underlined.</p>

    <b>This text is bold.</b><br>
    <i>This text is italic.</i><br>
    <u>This text is underlined.</u>

    <h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>
    <p>This tag simply adds a horizontal line in the page, used to seperate sections. </p>

    <p>This is the first section.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is the second section.</p>
